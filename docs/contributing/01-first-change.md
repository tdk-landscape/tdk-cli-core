# 1. Get ready to make a change

Follow these steps once. They set up the tools used by the TDK CLI and its checks.

## You need

- Git
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- Node.js 22.12 or newer
- Docker and [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html) only if you need to run TDK services or check a full local environment

## Copy the repo to your computer

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core.git
cd tdk-cli-core
bun install
git switch -c my-change
```

Replace `my-change` with a short name, for example `docs-new-framework-guide`.

## Find one change

1. Open the [good first issues](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/labels/help%20wanted).
2. Read the issue and check whether someone is already working on it.
3. Comment that you would like to take it. If there is no issue, open one describing the change before starting a large feature.
4. Use [the feature recipes](02-feature-recipes.md) to find the likely files and checks.

## When to write a change proposal

Use OpenSpec when a change affects a user-facing contract, a manifest or generated format, or several subsystems. The [Vue provider change](../../openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-28-add-vue-frontend-adapter/proposal.md) is a completed example with a proposal, design, specs, and tasks. If the `openspec` command is not installed on your machine, ask in the issue before starting a cross-cutting change.

From the repository root:

```bash
openspec list
openspec new change "short-change-name"
openspec status --change "short-change-name"
```

Follow the instructions printed by OpenSpec to create the proposal, design, specs, and tasks that apply. A typo fix, link correction, or small isolated change usually does not need a proposal.

## Run a quick check

From the repository root, the CLI checks are:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
```

Run the checks again after your last edit. If a check fails, include the failure in your PR and say what you tried. See [the PR guide](03-open-a-pr.md) for area-specific checks.
