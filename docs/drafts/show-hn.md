# Show HN: TDK CLI – service.json to a local Docker/Tilt stack, no cluster

TDK CLI turns a `service.json` per service into a local Docker stack, with Tilt (the local development tool) watching services and live-updating containers as you code. It is not a deploy tool and not a Compose replacement. Production stays on Helm.

```sh
mkdir shop && cd shop
tdk project --yes
tdk resource orders-api --type backend --stack shop --yes
tdk up shop
```

Then open `http://api.shop.localhost/api/orders-api/health`.

TDK runs local development services through Docker and Tilt. It does not deploy to a cluster and does not replace Compose for a small stack you already maintain. Native Windows is inspect-only; landscape startup needs Ubuntu on WSL2.

The warm demo brings 14 tiny services healthy in 4.6s on a 16 GB M1 after images existed. Not a cold boot. Separately, 100 generated `/health` stubs, about 20 lines each, became healthy through Traefik in 472s on a clean Ubuntu runner; [that fixture run](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/actions/runs/36395860088) is not an ERP workload.
