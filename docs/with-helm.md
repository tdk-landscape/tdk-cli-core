# TDK + Helm (they are not alternatives)

TDK runs many services on your laptop with Docker + Tilt. Helm still deploys the cluster.

```text
Laptop:  service.json  ->  tdk up  ->  Docker + Tilt + Traefik *.localhost
Cluster: same image    ->  Helm / Flux / Argo  ->  Deployment + Service + Ingress
```

TDK is the local development inner loop. It scaffolds services, generates local Dockerfile layers and Tilt configuration, starts local proxy/Postgres services, and lets you run a subset of stacks. Helm and your cluster tooling own replicas, readiness/liveness probes, ingress class and hosts, PVCs, node selectors, IRSA, HPA, and other production policy.

Keep your existing bjw-s app-template, official charts, homegrown charts, Kustomize, Flux, or Argo workflow. TDK does not require a cluster for `tdk up` and does not replace the production release path. Skip TDK when `helm install`, Compose, or your existing Tilt setup already gives you a working local environment.

## A conceptual mapping

These fields are related ideas, not a one-to-one configuration translation. Local startup order, routes, and resource types do not define a cluster release.

`service.json` configures TDK's laptop development loop. Helm `values.yaml` configures chart resources for Kubernetes. Shared concepts such as an image name or port must be deliberately carried across; the files are not equivalent, and TDK does not generate Helm values.

| TDK `service.json` or local behavior | Typical Helm / app-template concept | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `appName` | Release name or controller id | Identity only; chart naming is configurable. |
| `appType` | Controller type (Deployment, Job, CronJob) | TDK type does not select or configure the cluster controller. |
| `port` | `service.main.ports.http.port` | Confirm the container and Service ports for your image. |
| `healthCheckPath` | Readiness or liveness probe path | Add and tune probes for cluster operation explicitly. |
| `dependsOn` | Deployment ordering, hooks, or init behavior | Local dependency ordering is not a cluster startup contract. |
| Traefik `*.localhost` route | Ingress or Gateway API host | Configure class, DNS, TLS, and routing in your cluster workflow. |
| Local Postgres feature | External database or a chart dependency | Choose lifecycle, persistence, credentials, and backups for production. |

## One backend through both paths

Scaffold a local backend in a project:

```bash
tdk project --yes
tdk resource api --type backend --stack shop --yes
tdk up shop
```

TDK runs the service through Docker and Tilt with hot reload and a local `*.localhost` route. See the [runnable one-backend example](../examples/one-backend/README.md) for the manifest, code, exact URL, health request, and cleanup.

The matching [handwritten app-template values](../examples/one-backend-helm/values.yaml) use the same service source and show an explicit image repository, tag, and HTTP port. Before Helm can use it, build and publish that image through your existing CI/build workflow to a registry your cluster can access. TDK's local Docker image is not published automatically.

The example pins the official `oci://ghcr.io/bjw-s-labs/helm/app-template` chart to `5.2.1`. The [official chart documentation](https://bjw-s-labs.github.io/helm-charts/docs/app-template/), [5.2.1 release notes](https://github.com/bjw-s-labs/helm-charts/releases/tag/app-template-5.2.1), and [matching values schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjw-s-labs/helm-charts/app-template-5.2.1/charts/other/app-template/values.schema.json) describe the chart contract. Fetch the pinned chart, then lint and render the sample without installing it:

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/bjw-s-labs/helm/app-template \
  --version 5.2.1 --untar --untardir /tmp/tdk-helm-example
helm lint /tmp/tdk-helm-example/app-template \
  --values examples/one-backend-helm/values.yaml
helm template api /tmp/tdk-helm-example/app-template \
  --values examples/one-backend-helm/values.yaml
```

The example intentionally leaves replicas, probes, ingress, PVCs, resources, security context, identity, and autoscaling to the deployment owner. A local frontend served through nginx/Traefik still needs a separately configured cluster ingress or Gateway. A worker requires an explicit `Job` or `CronJob` choice and (for a CronJob) a schedule; TDK cannot infer either.

## Keep writing Helm values by hand

There is no Helm export command in this workflow. Write chart values using the schema and documentation for your pinned chart release. The example is a starting point for understanding the handoff, not a supported production chart. `tdk config verify` checks generated project files against `.tdk/project.json`; it does not lint `service.json` or Helm values. `tdk doctor` checks local environment readiness and service issues, not production chart configuration.
