## 1. Baseline

- [x] 1.1 Add a small script (or `tdk` debug command) that prints per-resource build durations from Tilt's `uiresources` build history for a running project. (`scripts/benchmark/tilt-build-durations.mjs`)
- [x] 1.2 Record a baseline on `tdk-restaurant-example`: one cold-cache and three warm `tdk up` runs, with machine, Docker CPU/memory and TDK version. Post it on #1023. (posted: cold 63 s, warm 10 to 18 s)

## 2. Golden images: skip when unchanged, bake when not

- [x] 2.1 Compute the golden hash over the golden Dockerfile content and pinned base images.
- [x] 2.2 Generate a bake file from `GOLDEN_LAYERS` with one target per image, tags, and the `tdk.golden.hash` label.
- [x] 2.3 Change `build_golden_layers` to skip when every tag exists with the matching label, otherwise run `docker buildx bake --load`, falling back to the serial `docker build` loop with a log line when bake is unavailable.
- [x] 2.4 Add a way to force a golden rebuild and document it.
- [x] 2.5 Tests: bake targets and tags match `GOLDEN_LAYERS`; command text contains the skip check, bake call and fallback. (`cli/src/utils/__tests__/golden-build-tilt.test.ts` runs the generated script with a fake docker)
- [ ] 2.6 Measure warm and changed-Dockerfile runs on the restaurant example and post on #1023.

## 3. Tilt build concurrency

- [x] 3.1 Emit `update_settings(max_parallel_updates=N)` in the generated Tiltfile, computed from `docker info` with the clamp in the design, honoring `TDK_MAX_PARALLEL_BUILDS`.
- [x] 3.2 Log the chosen value and its source at Tiltfile load; keep Tilt's default when `docker info` fails.
- [x] 3.3 Update golden Tiltfile snapshots in `cli/src/generator/__tests__/golden/` and add a test for the override and failure paths. (snapshots updated; the value and the override/failure wiring are tested in `build-performance-tilt.test.ts`)
- [x] 3.4 Measure peak Docker memory during a restaurant warm start at the chosen `N` and adjust the per-build budget if needed. (Docker VM sampling is not a per-start measure: the VM's resident memory rises during the cold build and stays high (6.9 GB after the cold run, 3 to 6 GB in warm runs). An earlier 1.9 GB figure came from a smaller starting VM and is not comparable. The 1.5 GiB budget is unchanged. See benchmarks/results/tdk-up-warm-start-2026-10-11/README.md.)
- [x] 3.5 Measure and post on #1023. (posted)

## 4. Frontend builds

- [x] 4.1 Detect the standard `tsc --noEmit && vite build[ ...]` build-script form (non-emitting type-check only); for it, emit a direct `bunx vite build --config <generated build config>` step in the L3 frontend stage. Leave other script forms unchanged.
- [x] 4.2 Register a non-blocking `<service>-typecheck` local resource for those frontends.
- [x] 4.3 Tests for the detection (standard forms, custom scripts, missing script) and the generated Dockerfile step. (`build-performance-tilt.test.ts`, evaluated by Tilt)
- [x] 4.5 Name `<service>-typecheck` in the focus filter so focus mode enables it (regression test in template-engine.test.ts).
- [x] 4.4 Measure frontend build time and the end-to-end warm start; post on #1023. (floor-app and reservation-app: about 22 s cold, 2.5 to 5.6 s warm)

## 5. Docs and follow-ups

- [x] 5.1 Document the golden skip, the force-rebuild option, `TDK_MAX_PARALLEL_BUILDS`, and the type-check resource. (`engine/docs/GOLDEN_IMAGE_INTEGRATION.md`)
- [x] 5.2 Open follow-up issues for registry-backed golden images and caches, and for L2 lockfile handling. (#1027, #1028)
