## 1. Release asset contract and workflow gates

- [x] 1.1 Audit `tdk-cli-core` release script/workflow and make required release assets explicit, including non-empty PE `MZ` validation, EXE checksum/ZIP inclusion, and published asset-list verification.
- [ ] 1.2 Add a Windows AMD64 smoke job that consumes the exact candidate assets, verifies EXE and engine hashes, checks version parity, and runs `project --yes` with the sibling engine layout.
- [ ] 1.3 Order publication so a failed asset or Windows runtime gate prevents npm publication and latest promotion; verify release concurrency still prevents same-version races.

## 2. Installer integrity

- [ ] 2.1 Update `tdk-landscape.github.io/install.ps1` to parse and verify the engine archive checksum before extraction, with clear failures for missing entries and mismatches.
- [ ] 2.2 Confirm executable and engine verification both happen before installation mutates the target directory.

## 3. Public documentation

- [ ] 3.1 Update `tdk-cli-releases/README.md` with the Windows EXE in the asset list, five-binary ZIP wording, and manual installation layout.
- [ ] 3.2 Update the installer site and `tdk-website` quick start to describe the Windows installer accurately while retaining caveats until release evidence is complete.
- [ ] 3.3 Add the Windows AMD64 asset reference to `awesome-tdk-framework` without modifying example repositories.
- [ ] 3.4 After verified publication, remove pending-asset caveats and record the Windows 11 manual acceptance result; otherwise leave the caveats in place.

## 4. Release verification

- [ ] 4.1 Run release workflow asset checks and Windows smoke against a candidate, confirming checksum, version, project scaffold, ZIP membership, and release asset listing.
- [ ] 4.2 Verify the latest-download URL returns successfully and the PowerShell installer works on a clean Windows 11 AMD64 environment.
- [ ] 4.3 Complete and record the manual Windows 11 AMD64 checklist and confirm public docs make no claim beyond the evidence.
