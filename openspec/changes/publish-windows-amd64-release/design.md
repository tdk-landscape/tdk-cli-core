## Context

The existing pipeline in `tdk-cli-core` cross-compiles the Windows AMD64 executable and checks its PE header, checksum, and ZIP inclusion. The Windows-specific runtime path and adjacent engine layout are not exercised on a Windows runner. The release README and website materials span repositories, and the installer currently validates the executable but not the engine archive. A separate broader Windows support change already defines platform support and initial installer behavior; this design completes public release readiness without expanding the platform support claim.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Prevent promotion of a release to latest unless the required Windows executable and companion assets are verified.
- Exercise the release candidate on Windows with checksum, version, and engine/template-resolution checks using the installed layout.
- Verify both downloaded archives in the PowerShell installer.
- Keep public Windows release language tied to passing release evidence.

**Non-Goals:**
- Windows ARM64, Authenticode signing, package-manager distribution, Docker-based end-to-end boot, or changes to Unix asset names.
- Republishing binaries from documentation or consumer repositories.
- Claiming full native Windows `tdk up` support based only on CLI smoke coverage.

## Decisions

- **Smoke the release candidate on Windows before npm and latest promotion.** Build once, hand the exact candidate files to the Windows job as a workflow artifact, and run `--version` plus `runtime --check-assets --json` with the engine extracted beside the executable. This catches runtime/layout failures that Linux PE validation cannot without requiring Docker Desktop or changing the project command's readiness behavior. Publish only after this gate passes.
- **Treat release assets as a required contract.** Validate the four existing Unix binaries, Windows executable, engine archive, checksum manifest, and versioned ZIP. Check all required local assets, checksum entries, and intended ZIP members; after upload, compare remote asset names and bytes with the candidate. Allow additional release assets that are not part of this workflow. Promote as latest only after gates pass.
- **Verify checksums from the published manifest.** The installer will compare both executable and engine SHA-256 values against `checksums.txt` before extracting/installing. Missing entries and mismatches fail with actionable errors.
- **Make documentation evidence-gated.** Keep pending/caveat wording until the latest release has the asset and the Windows smoke succeeds. Update the release repository README, installation story, website quick start, and framework index in the corresponding repositories once evidence exists. Retain Docker Desktop Linux-container mode and AMD64 limits.
- **Keep manual full-boot acceptance separate from the release blocker.** Document a Windows 11 AMD64 checklist for install, doctor, scaffold, and optional `tdk up`; do not make Docker Desktop a hosted CI prerequisite.

Alternatives considered: testing only the compiled file on Linux is insufficient for runtime behavior; testing `main` instead of the release candidate does not establish that the uploaded assets match; publishing latest before smoke would expose unverified assets. Rebuilding separately on Windows risks artifacts differing from those users download. Downloading a draft release in the Windows job would require cross-repository release credentials; a workflow artifact passes the exact build output without that token.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [A job could accidentally rebuild after smoke] → Publish from the same workflow artifact that the Windows job downloaded; never rebuild in the publish job.
- [Windows runner environment may lack Docker/Tilt] → Keep the smoke limited to CLI version and packaged runtime asset resolution; do not require Docker.
- [Checksum manifest formatting may differ across platforms] → Parse by exact asset filename and fail clearly when an entry is absent or malformed.
- [Manual Windows 11 acceptance cannot run on hosted CI] → Record it as a release-readiness checklist and keep broader support language gated on that evidence.

## Migration Plan

1. Add asset/package checks and a Windows smoke gate to release automation.
2. Add engine checksum verification to `install.ps1`.
3. Run the workflow for a candidate and verify latest-release download access after promotion.
4. Update public docs only when all required evidence is green; otherwise preserve caveats and record the failed gate.
5. Rollback by reverting the workflow/installer/docs changes. If a bad release is already latest, publish a corrected version through the normal immutable versioned release process and repoint latest only after all gates pass.

## Open Questions

- Record the manual Windows 11 acceptance result in a tracked document before removing full-stack support caveats. This result is distinct from the hosted runtime-assets smoke and must not be inferred from it.
