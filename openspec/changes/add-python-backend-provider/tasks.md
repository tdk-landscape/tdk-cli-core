## 1. Preserve the existing Bun backend

- [x] 1.1 Add `cli/src/backend-languages/` with a provider type and registry. Keep `DEFAULT_BACKEND_LANGUAGE` set to `bun`.
- [x] 1.2 Move the existing Hono entry, package scripts, and Bun Dockerfile choices into the Bun provider without changing omitted-language output.
- [x] 1.3 Capture today's Bun file set in a test before extraction and keep that test green afterward.
- [x] 1.4 Keep legacy backend `service.json` files without `language` valid; discovery and `tdk up` must not rewrite them only to insert the field.
- [x] 1.5 Keep interactive creation on Bun without prompting for a language.
- [x] 1.6 Reject unknown `--language` values and use on non-backend types before writing files. Match registered ids case-insensitively.

## 2. Node.js template (deferred)

Cut from this change at review: a Node provider that has never been built in Docker is a second feature. It returns as its own change with an example, a `test` stage, and an image-build E2E.


## 3. Add the Python chosen template

- [x] 3.1 Register `python`. Generate a FastAPI app, `/health`, `pyproject.toml`, and a pytest smoke test.
- [x] 3.2 Add `language` to `engine/schemas/service-schema.json` with `bun` and `python`. Add a drift test so schema ids and registry ids stay identical.
- [x] 3.3 Add Starlark Python image and Tilt live-update behavior at the existing generated paths; leave Bun templates unchanged.
- [x] 3.4 Test Python output, persisted metadata, case-insensitive selection, unknown id rejection, non-backend rejection, and legacy manifest compatibility.
- [x] 3.5 Verify FastAPI, uvicorn, and Python service dependencies are not added to the TDK CLI package.

## 4. Ship the runnable Python example

- [x] 4.1 Add `examples/one-backend-python/` mirroring `examples/one-backend/`: `services/one-backend-python/api/service.json` with `"language": "python"`, `pyproject.toml`, `src/main.py`, `tests/test_health.py`, and `README.md`.
- [x] 4.2 Write the README with prerequisites (Docker, Tilt, TDK CLI; no host Python), `tdk project --yes`, `tdk up one-backend-python`, the `curl --fail .../health` check, the Tilt dashboard URL, and `tdk down`.
- [x] 4.3 Add a drift test that compares the example source with `tdk resource --type backend --language python` output, ignoring service name and stack.
- [x] 4.4 Add a path-filtered CI job that boots the example, curls routed `/health`, runs pytest inside the built image, uploads Tilt and container logs on failure, and runs `tdk down`.
- [ ] 4.5 (blocked on the Tilt live-update `basePath` bug, not on the Dockerfile; fixed separately in [tdk-cli-core#228](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/pull/228). Re-verify on the Python example after #228 merges) Verify by hand that editing `src/main.py` live-reloads and editing `pyproject.toml` rebuilds the image.
  - Hand check (2026-10-01): editing `pyproject.toml` rebuilt the image as expected, but editing `src/main.py` did not live-update. Tilt logged `LiveUpdate ... UpdateStopped: Found file(s) not matching any sync` and fell back to a full rebuild. The LiveUpdate `basePath` is `.tdk/.tdk-out` while sync `localPath` is `services/...`, so the syncs never match. Seen on the Bun auth-queue example too, so it is likely pre-existing and not Python-specific. Needs its own fix.
- [x] 4.6 Link the example from `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `cli/README.md`, and `docs/backend-language-providers.md`.

## 5. Make database readiness truthful and verify the default example

- [ ] 5.1 Reproduce the failed example E2E: `orders-api` waits on `tdk_example_shop`, `/api/orders/health` returns 404, and Tilt reports `provision-db-shop` updated while the database is absent.
- [ ] 5.2 Trace the `DATABASE_URL` name, `provision-db-<stack>` target, and backend `resource_deps`; guarantee they identify the same database and that provisioning runs before the backend.
- [ ] 5.3 Make database provisioning fail when the database cannot be created or verified. A successful Tilt update must mean the configured database exists and accepts a connection.
- [ ] 5.4 Extend the default example E2E to assert the stack database exists, routed `/api/orders/health` returns success, and the existing API/worker write/read path completes.
- [ ] 5.5 Keep health probes from treating a backend as ready until its required database is available; confirm the request does not fall through to Traefik's 404 response after startup.

## 6. Document the provider contract

- [x] 6.1 Add `docs/backend-language-providers.md` modeled on `docs/frontend-framework-providers.md`, covering the file map, provider registration, shared-versus-owned responsibilities, the Docker/reload exception, and a one-provider-per-implementation-PR checklist.
- [x] 6.2 Link the backend guide from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [x] 6.3 Document `tdk resource api --type backend --language python --stack shop` in `cli/README.md`; state that omitting `--language` keeps the existing Bun default.
- [x] 6.4 State that `bring-your-own` remains the path for languages without a provider.
