## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Minimal public catalog repository
The TDK resource landscape SHALL be published in a public GitHub repository named `tdk-landscape/awesome-tdk-framework`. Its only tracked files SHALL be the root-level `README.md` catalog and `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide.

#### Scenario: Repository contents are constrained
- **WHEN** the initial catalog repository is published
- **THEN** its tracked file list contains exactly `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, both at the repository root

#### Scenario: Catalog is publicly discoverable
- **WHEN** a reader opens the canonical repository URL
- **THEN** the repository is public and renders the catalog README as its landing page

### Requirement: Navigable resource taxonomy
The catalog README SHALL organize TDK-relevant resources under descriptive Markdown headings and provide a linked table of contents for its substantive sections.

#### Scenario: Reader navigates to a topic
- **WHEN** a reader selects a table-of-contents entry
- **THEN** the link navigates to the matching section in the README

#### Scenario: Catalog covers the ecosystem
- **WHEN** the initial catalog is reviewed
- **THEN** it includes applicable resources in categories for official projects, getting started and documentation, tutorials, examples and demos, starters and templates, extensions and integrations, development and operations, observability and security, community projects, articles, gists, videos or talks, and related tools

#### Scenario: Empty categories are avoided
- **WHEN** a category has no verified resource to list
- **THEN** the README omits that empty category until useful content is available

### Requirement: Useful and trustworthy link entries
Each catalog entry SHALL link directly to a relevant public resource and include a human-readable title and concise description. The README SHALL distinguish official resources from community-maintained resources where that distinction is useful and SHALL identify known archived or unmaintained resources.

#### Scenario: Resource is added
- **WHEN** a new resource is included
- **THEN** its destination is checked, its title and relevance are clear, and its description accurately summarizes the destination

#### Scenario: Resource provenance is clear
- **WHEN** a reader encounters a community-maintained or archived resource
- **THEN** its status is labeled so the reader can distinguish it from current official resources

#### Scenario: Duplicate or noncanonical link is proposed
- **WHEN** the same resource already appears or a more authoritative canonical destination exists
- **THEN** the catalog keeps one entry pointing to the canonical destination

### Requirement: Contribution guide and README pointer
The repository SHALL provide detailed inclusion criteria, entry formatting, provenance labels, and submission steps in its root `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The catalog README SHALL link to that guide and provide a concise route to suggest additions or corrections through GitHub issues or pull requests.

#### Scenario: Contributor proposes an item
- **WHEN** a reader wants to add or correct a resource
- **THEN** the README links to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and to the issue tracker, and the guide provides the expected title, link, description, provenance/status information, and submission steps

#### Scenario: Proposed item does not meet curation criteria
- **WHEN** a proposed link is unrelated, inaccessible, duplicative, or lacks enough context to assess
- **THEN** the curation guidance in `CONTRIBUTING.md` allows maintainers to request clarification or decline the item

### Requirement: Organization profile discovery
The existing TDK organization profile README SHALL link prominently to the public `awesome-tdk-framework` catalog.

#### Scenario: Reader starts from organization profile
- **WHEN** a reader views the TDK organization profile
- **THEN** they can follow a clearly labeled link to the catalog repository
