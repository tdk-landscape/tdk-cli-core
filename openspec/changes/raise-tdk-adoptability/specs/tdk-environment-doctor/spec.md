## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Doctor checks and ranks environment blockers
`tdk doctor` SHALL check whether Docker is running, whether Docker uses Linux containers, whether Tilt meets the documented minimum version, and whether Bun meets the documented minimum when the stack requires Bun. It SHALL check whether ports 80, 443, and 5432 are bound, identify WSL projects under `/mnt/c`, and identify unsupported native Windows execution. It SHALL order remediation guidance before status summaries and SHALL exit 1 if any required check fails. Port conflicts SHALL appear before lower-priority failures in the first failure block.

#### Scenario: Required database port is already bound
- **WHEN** port 5432 is bound while doctor reports other environment results
- **THEN** the first failure block identifies port 5432, gives a fix, and doctor exits 1

#### Scenario: Required tool is missing or too old
- **WHEN** Tilt is missing or below its documented floor, or required Bun is missing or below its floor
- **THEN** doctor reports the requirement and an actionable fix, and exits 1

#### Scenario: Docker cannot run the landscape
- **WHEN** the daemon is down or Docker is using Windows containers
- **THEN** doctor reports the corresponding fix before status summaries and exits 1

### Requirement: WSL project placement is diagnosed
When running in WSL2 Ubuntu, doctor SHALL warn if the project is under `/mnt/c` because hot reload may be impaired. With `--strict`, that placement SHALL fail the check and cause exit 1.

#### Scenario: Project is under the Windows-mounted filesystem
- **WHEN** doctor detects the current WSL project under `/mnt/c`
- **THEN** default mode warns that hot reload may be impaired, while `--strict` reports a failure and exits 1

### Requirement: Native Windows landscape startup is unsupported
On native Windows, `tdk doctor` SHALL exit non-zero and instruct the user to use WSL2 Ubuntu with Docker Desktop integration, linking to `docs/wsl2.md`.

#### Scenario: Doctor runs in native Windows
- **WHEN** `tdk doctor` detects a native Windows host
- **THEN** it exits non-zero and prints the WSL2 Ubuntu + Docker Desktop integration instruction and `docs/wsl2.md` link
