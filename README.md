### Stop letting AI hallucinate your local infrastructure.

LLMs are brilliant at writing application logic, but notoriously terrible at maintaining local infrastructure. Every time your AI rewrites a `Dockerfile`, misconfigures a `Tiltfile`, or breaks an `nginx.conf`, it wastes your developer focus and burns thousands of unnecessary API tokens.

**TDK CLI Core** bridges the gap. You write the clean web application logic, and TDK instantly autodetects your stack to generate, link, and orchestrate the local environment for you. 

### ⚡ Zero-Config Local Stacks in 3 Seconds
No vendor lock-in. No tedious plumbing. Run a single command to natively orchestrate **72 different integration tiers** including:
* **Runtimes & Frameworks:** Bun, Node, Python, Go, Rust, React, Vue, Svelte, Elysia, Fastify, NestJS
* **Databases & Tooling:** Prisma, Drizzle, Atlas, Dbmate
* **Messaging & Gateway:** NATS, Traefik


TDK CLI — start services on your laptop. It is not a deploy and not a Compose file: define each service in `service.json`, then run `tdk up`. No Kubernetes is needed on the machine.

Stability: 1.x local dev. Write `service.json`; TDK generates the local runtime files. See [what TDK writes](docs/generated-files.md) and how to check for drift. Core CLI is MIT and needs no key. Premium is optional.

Docker runs the containers. Tilt watches services and live-updates containers while you code. TDK CLI writes the configuration Tilt uses. Production deployment stays with Helm, Argo CD, or Kustomize.

`tdk ui` opens an interactive terminal dashboard for inspecting running services. Move with `↑/↓` or `j/k`, search with `/`, and press `1`–`5` to jump between tabs. See [docs/ui.md](docs/ui.md) for every key binding.

## Who uses TDK

No teams are listed yet. Be the first: [tell us you use TDK](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/issues/new?template=we-use-tdk.yml) or [add a row to ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md).

If TDK saves you time, a ⭐ on [this repo](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core) helps other developers find it.

## Quick start

```bash
mkdir shop && cd shop
tdk project --yes
tdk resource orders-api --type backend --stack shop --yes
tdk up shop
curl http://api.shop.localhost:8080/api/orders/health
```

`tdk up` prints the host ports it chose. Port 8080 is the default; if it was taken, use the HTTP port `tdk up` reports (or set `TDK_HTTP_PORT`). A resource named `orders-api` is served at `/api/orders` (a trailing `-api` is dropped); `tdk up` prints the exact URLs.

*Scaffolding a backend and frontend, then listing the stack.*

### What TDK writes for a frontend

You maintain `service.json`; TDK generates the local runtime files. A frontend such as `services/store/storefront-web` has files like these after generation:

```text
services/store/storefront-web/
├── service.json                         # your service definition
└── .autogenerated/                     # TDK writes these files
    ├── nginx.autogenerated.conf        # serves the build and routes API requests
    ├── Dockerfile.app.autogenerated     # local app image
    ├── .env.frontend.autogenerated      # local frontend environment
    ├── vite.config.frontend.autogenerated.ts
    ├── tsconfig.autogenerated.json
    └── api-client.ts                    # generated API client
```

You do not need to write the nginx config, Dockerfile, or a `docker-compose.yml` for this local stack. `tdk up` uses Docker and Tilt to start it. The [generated-files guide](docs/generated-files.md) lists the other outputs and explains how regeneration and drift checks work.

If Helm, Compose, or your existing Tilt setup already gives you a working local environment, keep using it. TDK CLI is for engineers managing several services who want a clear local service contract and one command to start the stack.

See [how TDK CLI works alongside Helm](https://tdk-landscape.github.io/tdk-website/docs/with-helm/), the [service schema](engine/schemas/service-schema.json), and the [project configuration schema](engine/schemas/project-schema.json).

## Terminal UI

Use `tdk ui` to inspect stacks and resources. Arrow keys or `j`/`k` move the
selection; `g`/`G` or Home/End jump to the first/last item, and PageUp/PageDown
move one visible page. `/` searches; navigation letters remain search text
while searching. The selected row stays visible when the terminal is resized.

## Installation

Install the CLI from npm (requires Node.js 22.12+) or use the prebuilt binary (no Node.js or Bun required):

```bash
npm install -g @tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core
# or install the prebuilt binary
curl -fsSL https://tdk-landscape.github.io/install.sh | sh
```

`tdk up shop --dry-run` previews selected local services and URLs before starting containers. The default starter is Bun/TypeScript; TDK's core role is running local containers through Docker + Tilt, not providing a Node.js application framework. See the [one-backend example](examples/one-backend/README.md).

## When not to use TDK

- Your existing Compose or Tilt workflow already gives you a working local environment.
- Helm is your whole development workflow and you do not want local services on Docker.
- You do not want `service.json` manifests and generated local configuration.

## Troubleshooting
Set `TDK_DEBUG=1` before running `tdk up --verbose` to include Starlark debug logs in Tilt output.

## History

TDK development began on 21 April 2026. The archived, read-only [tdk-landscape/tdk](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk)
repository records its [first commit](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk/commit/1714637637196ed54cbfa18534230a782c05ab36)
("Initial commit: TDK specs, generators, CLI, and standards") from that day. A separate `tdk-cli` history spanning 21 April to
18 September 2026 was [imported into this repository](https://github.com/tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core/pull/670) as 306 filtered
commits. Those commits are now ancestors of `main`; the import did not change the source tree.

This `tdk-cli-core` repository was created on 19 September 2026, and the `@tdk-landscape/tdk-cli-core` npm package was first
published on 21 September 2026. Those dates describe the current repository and package, not the start of TDK development.

## Requirements and support

For the local runtime, install Docker (Desktop, OrbStack, or Colima; Engine 25+, Compose 2.20.2+) and [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html). Bun 1.2+ is used by the default generated services. TDK selects host ports from bounded fallback ranges for HTTP, HTTPS, and Postgres; set `TDK_HTTP_PORT`, `TDK_HTTPS_PORT`, or `TDK_POSTGRES_PORT` to override them. Dev ports listen on `127.0.0.1` only, so other machines on your network cannot reach them. Set `TDK_BIND_ADDRESS` (for example `0.0.0.0`, to test from a phone) to change that; `tdk doctor` warns when it is a wildcard address. TDK supports macOS, Linux, and Windows through WSL2 Ubuntu; native Windows supports CLI inspection only. Run `tdk doctor` to check local readiness (supports `--no-ping` to skip service health checks and `--ping-timeout <ms>`). See [WSL2 setup](docs/wsl2.md).

On native Windows, `tdk --version`, `tdk doctor`, and `tdk up --dry-run` are inspect-only commands. `tdk up` exits 2 with “Landscape startup needs Ubuntu on WSL2. Native Windows is inspect-only.”
