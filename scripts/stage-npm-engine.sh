# npm's `files` field can only package files inside the package directory

# scripts/release-binaries.sh bundles as tdk-cli/ next to the compiled
# binaries. Staging them here lets findSelfContainedEngineRoot() in
# template-engine.ts (vendorTdkExtension) find them for an npm/bun-installed
# package the same way it already does for a plain git clone: Tiltfile and
# engine/ sitting next to each other.

# Cleaned up by --clean (also gitignored, so a forgotten copy never lands in
