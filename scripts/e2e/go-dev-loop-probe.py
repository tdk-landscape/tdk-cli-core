"""Drive the Go development loop of a running `tdk up` project and check what it does (#369).

Called by scripts/e2e/go-dev-loop.sh. It edits main.go, polls the service through Traefik every 25 ms, reads Tilt's own log, and exits 1
if an acceptance check fails:

  1. each valid edit is served without recreating the container or rebuilding the image,
  2. the app is never down for long during an edit: a stretch of refused connections or 502s (the swap gap) must be no longer than
     max(1 s, 30% of that edit's edit-to-ready time). The old build has to keep serving while the new one compiles; a watcher that
     stops the app first is down for the whole compile and fails this. A Traefik 503 (its 10 s health check removed the route while
     the app restarted) is reported, not failed: it is Traefik's behaviour, not the watcher's,
  3. a broken edit puts the compiler error in Tilt's log and the last good build keeps serving,
  4. the next valid edit is served again,
  5. a go.mod change takes the dependency path: Tilt rebuilds the image and recreates the container, and the new response is served.
