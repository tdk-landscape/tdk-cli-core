# Tilt Master Spec File
# SYSTEM PATHS SPECIFICATION - No Hidden Magic
# Format: Explicit constants for all system paths
# Philosophy: Make it obvious (Zig-style explicitness)

# =============================================================================
# 🚀 QUICK START (I Just Want to Add a Service)
# =============================================================================

# 1. Create your service directory:
#    mkdir -p services/product/my-service/backend
#
# 2. Create a manifest file:
#    echo '{"appName":"my-service","port":4001}' > services/product/my-service/service.json
#
# 3. Run Tilt:
#    tilt up
#
# 4. Done! Your service is running. Configs generated at:
#    .tilt/output/configs/my-service/
#
# Need to debug? See DEBUG section at the bottom of this file.

# =============================================================================
# 📖 HOW TO USE THIS FILE
# =============================================================================

# In your Tiltfile or topology module, load this spec:
#
#     load(PROJECT_ROOT + "/.tilt-engine/spec.master", "SPEC", "CONSTANTS", "VALIDATION", "DEBUG")
#
# Then use the constants:
#
#     registry_path = SPEC.DISCOVERY.REGISTRY
#     max_port = VALIDATION.MAX_PORT
#     timeout = CONSTANTS.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
#
# That's it! No magic paths. Everything is explicit.

# =============================================================================
# 📁 WHAT'S IN THIS FILE
# =============================================================================

# SPEC = File paths and directory locations
#        (Where things live - TOPOLOGIES, DISCOVERY, GENERATORS, etc.)
#
# CONSTANTS = System values and defaults
#             (Timeouts, intervals, supported features, system info)
#
# VALIDATION = Constraints and limits
#              (Port ranges, replica limits, naming rules)
#
# DEBUG = Debugging and observability toggles
#         (How to see what's happening when things break)
#
# Don't see what you need? Ctrl+F to search this file.

# =============================================================================
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES
# =============================================================================

# PROJECT_ROOT is automatically set by Tiltfile based on where you run `tilt up`.
# You don't need to set it. Example:
#   - If you run in /home/dev/my-project, PROJECT_ROOT = "/home/dev/my-project"
#   - All other paths are built from this root.
#
# This file is manually maintained to match the directory structure.
# If you add new topology modules, update this file and increment SYSTEM_VERSION.

# =============================================================================
# 🔧 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST (When Things Break)
# =============================================================================

# Error: "port X outside valid range [1024-65535]"
#   → Check which service has "port": X in its service.json
#   → Enable DEBUG logging to see full validation output
#
# Error: "dependency Y not found"
#   → Check SPEC.DISCOVERY.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PATHS (where we look)
#   → Verify service Y exists in one of those paths
#   → Check service Y has a service.json file
#
# Error: "cannot load module Z"
#   → Check SPEC for the path - does the file actually exist?
#   → Run `ls -la` on the path to verify
#
# Something else broken?
#   → Set DEBUG.DUMP_CONTEXT_ON_GENERATION = True (see DEBUG section)
#   → Re-run tilt up and check the logs
#   → The full context will be printed showing exactly what's happening

# =============================================================================
# 🗓️  FEATURE FLAGS (What's Working vs Planned)
# =============================================================================

# Legend:
#   ✅ = Feature is working and enabled
#   ⏸️  = Feature exists but disabled
#   🗓️  = Feature planned for future (not implemented yet)
#
# ISTIO_INTEGRATION = False (🗓️ ROADMAP - Q2 2026)
#   - We plan to auto-generate Istio service mesh configs
#   - Currently using Traefik for routing (working great!)
#
# BAZEL_INTEGRATION = False (🗓️ ROADMAP - when requested)
#   - We plan Bazel integration for hermetic builds
#   - Currently using Docker layer caching (90% of the benefits)
#
# Don't panic if you see 🗓️ - it just means "coming soon, not ready yet"

# =============================================================================
# 🗂️ WHERE FILES GO (And Why They Sometimes Disappear)
# =============================================================================

# Generated files live in: .tilt/output/configs/<service-name>/
#
# 🫥 They disappear when:
#    - You change service.json (Tilt regenerates them)
#    - You run tilt down (cleanup)
#    - Something broke (check tilt logs)
#
# 😌 DON'T PANIC! They're auto-generated. 
#    They come back when you run tilt up.
#    The SOURCE is your service.json, not these generated files.
#
# To see them again: tilt up
# To keep them forever: Look at OUTPUT.CONFIGS path (see below)

# =============================================================================
# 😰 MY SERVICE WON'T LAUNCH - CHECKLIST
# =============================================================================

# 1️⃣  Is service.json in the RIGHT PLACE?
#     ✅ Good: services/product/my-service/service.json
#     ❌ Bad: my-service/service.json (wrong folder!)
#     ❌ Bad: service.json (no folder!)
#
# 2️⃣  Is the JSON valid?
#     ✅ Test: python3 -m json.tool service.json
#     ❌ If error: Fix the JSON syntax
#
# 3️⃣  Did you wait 5 seconds?
#     Tilt scans every 5 seconds for new services
#     Be patient! 🐱
#
# 4️⃣  Still not working?
#     Run: tilt doctor
#     Look for 🔴 red errors
#     Ask in Slack with the error message

# =============================================================================
# 🐱 WHAT IS THIS FILE? (In Simple Words)
# =============================================================================

# This is a MAP 🗺️  that shows where all the Tilt files live.
#
# Think of it like this:
# - Your house = Project folder
# - spec.master = List of rooms and what's in them
# - You = Cat exploring the house 🐱
#

# 😰 SCARY ERRORS EXPLAINED (Don't Panic!)
# =============================================================================

# Error: "port X outside valid range [1024-65535]"
#   → 💚 Don't worry! Just change the port number
#   → Fix: Change "port": X to something between 1024-65535
#   → Check VALIDATION.MIN_PORT and MAX_PORT in this file
#
# Error: "dependency Y not found"
#   → 💚 Don't worry! Your service needs another service
#   → Fix: Check "dependencies" list in your service.json
#   → Make sure the other service exists and has service.json
#
# Error: "cannot load module Z"
#   → 💚 Don't worry! This might be a Tilt bug
#   → Try: tilt up again
#   → Or: restart Docker Desktop
#   → Check: Does the file path in SPEC actually exist?
#
# Error: "cannot load ext://..."
#   → 💚 Don't worry! This is usually a Tilt extension issue
#   → Try: tilt up again
#   → Or: Run `tilt doctor` to check setup
#
# 🔴 Red text ≠ Your fault!
# Most errors are fixable! 😊

# =============================================================================
# ✅ BOSS-READY CHECKLIST (Before Showing Your Work)
# =============================================================================

# Use this if your boss can only review once (sick, busy, etc.)
#
# Before showing your work, verify:
#
# □ Your service shows up in `tilt up`
# □ No 🔴 red error messages
# □ Service status says 🟢 "Running"
# □ You can open the URL (if there is one)
# □ Run: tilt doctor (should be mostly green)
#
# Quick check command:
#   $ tilt get uiresources | grep your-service-name
#
# If you see your service name → Good! 🎉
# If not → Check the troubleshooting section above

# =============================================================================
# 🎓 AM I DOING THIS RIGHT?
# =============================================================================

# Scenario 1: Adding a new service
# → You DON'T need to edit spec.master
# → Just create service.json and run tilt up
# → ✅ You're doing it right!
#
# Scenario 2: Finding where configs are
# → Open spec.master
# → Ctrl+F "OUTPUT" or "CONFIGS"
# → Look at the path
# → ✅ You're doing it right!
#
# Scenario 3: Something is broken
# → Open spec.master
# → Look at DEBUG section
# → Enable DEBUG.DUMP_CONTEXT_ON_GENERATION
# → Run tilt up again, check logs
# → ✅ You're doing it right!
#
# Most of the time:
# You DON'T need to edit spec.master.
# You just LOOK at it to find things.
# That's using it right! 😊

# =============================================================================
# 🔍 SEARCH THIS FILE
# =============================================================================

# Don't read all 400+ lines! Use Ctrl+F 🔍
#
# Suggested searches:
# - "DISCOVERY" → Where we find services
# - "GENERATORS" → What creates config files  
# - "OUTPUT" → Where files are written
# - "DEBUG" → How to troubleshoot
# - "VALIDATION" → Port/replica limits
# - "CONSTANTS" → Timeouts, defaults
#
# Search for what you need, then close the file!

# =============================================================================
# 📛 FILE ALIASES (Easier Names)
# =============================================================================

# Can't remember "spec.master"? Use these aliases:
#
#     .tilt/paths.star → Same file, easier name!
#     .tilt/where-things-live.star → Same file, fun name!
#
# So you can do:
#     load(PROJECT_ROOT + "/.tilt/paths.star", "SPEC")
#
# Instead of:
#     load(PROJECT_ROOT + "/.tilt-engine/spec.master", "SPEC")
#
# Both work! Use whichever you remember. 😊

# 🐛 DEBUGGING - How to Fix Things When They Break
# =============================================================================

# THREE WAYS TO USE DEBUG FLAGS:
#
# Method 1: Edit this file (affects all future runs)
#   DEBUG = DEBUG | struct(DUMP_CONTEXT_ON_GENERATION = True)
#   Then run `tilt up`
#
# Method 2: Environment variable (one-time, quick)
#   $ TILT_DEBUG_DUMP_CONTEXT=true tilt up
#   (Checks os.environ.get("TILT_DEBUG_DUMP_CONTEXT") at runtime)
#
# Method 3: Tilt args (when we implement --debug flags)
#   $ tilt up -- --debug-context
#
# WHAT EACH FLAG DOES:
#
# DUMP_CONTEXT_ON_GENERATION = True
#   → Prints the entire context object to logs
#   → Shows: resource_name, port, dependencies, paths
#   → Use when: "What values are being used?"
#
# DUMP_GENERATED_CONFIGS = True
#   → Writes all generated configs to OUTPUT.CONFIGS
#   → You can open and read them
#   → Use when: "What configs were generated?"
#
# LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
#   → Very verbose output showing every step
#   → Use when: "Where is it failing?"
#
# ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS = True
#   → Opens http://localhost:10350 for live inspection
#   → Use when: "I want to browse the current state"

DEBUG = struct(
    # Live debugging endpoint
    ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS = False,
    DEBUG_ENDPOINT_PORT = 10350,
    
    # What to dump/print during generation
    DUMP_CONTEXT_ON_GENERATION = False,   # Print full context to logs
    DUMP_GENERATED_CONFIGS = True,        # Write configs to disk for inspection
    
    # Logging configuration

"""
PHILOSOPHY: No hidden control flow. No hidden allocations. No magic.

This spec file makes EVERYTHING explicit:
1. ALL paths are constants - no runtime discovery
2. ALL patterns are declared - no hidden globbing
3. ALL features are toggled - no surprise behavior
4. ALL outputs are defined - no mystery files

COMPARISON:

❌ BEFORE (Implicit):
    load("./discovery/resource_registry.star", "get_app_resources")
    # Where does this file live? Magic.
    # What does it return? Runtime mystery.

✅ AFTER (Explicit):
    load(SPEC.DISCOVERY.REGISTRY, "get_app_resources")
    # Path is: {PROJECT_ROOT}/.tilt/topologies/tilt/discovery/resource_registry.star
    # Behavior defined in this spec file.

USAGE:
    load("{}/.tilt/spec.master".format(PROJECT_ROOT), "SPEC", "CONSTANTS")
    
    # Now EVERYTHING is explicit
    registry_path = SPEC.DISCOVERY.REGISTRY
    max_port = VALIDATION.MAX_PORT
    features = CONSTANTS.SUPPORTED_FEATURES

This is our answer to the Zig developer's critique:
"Make it obvious. No hidden state."
