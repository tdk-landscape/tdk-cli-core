# sanic

**Stack:** a minimal Sanic app (Python 3.12), two files: `app.py` and `requirements.txt`

**Notes:**
- Sanic has no project generator, so unlike the `create-*` examples the app is written out here (a `/health` route and a `/` route).
- `sanic app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --single-process` makes the server reachable from outside the container and uses the port
  TDK assigns. `--single-process` runs one worker, which is enough for local development and keeps the container's logs in one place.
- Through TDK, Traefik sends `Host: api.<project>.localhost`; Sanic accepted it with no host configuration (checked through a real
  `tdk up`).
- Sanic is pulled from PyPI at build time within `>=24,<26`.

## Check it

Needs Docker. Builds the image, runs it with `PORT=4000` and expects HTTP 200 on `/health`:

```bash
scripts/verify-byo-example.sh sanic
```

Through a real `tdk up` and Traefik, which sends `Host: api.<project>.localhost` (needs Docker, Tilt and a built CLI):

```bash
VERIFY_WAIT_SECONDS=300 scripts/verify-byo-tdk.sh sanic /health
```

## Register it in a TDK project

```bash
tdk resource sanic-api --type bring-your-own --stack shop --dockerfile ./Dockerfile --yes
```

Use a resource name that is unique across TDK projects sharing one Docker daemon. See
[../README.md](../README.md) and [docs/byo.md](../../../docs/byo.md) for the container contract.
